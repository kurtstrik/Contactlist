A ContactList written in Kotlin.
It consists of a MainActivity which has 2 Fragments - one for managing the existing contacts(search, delete, update) in InputFragment.kt - the other one containing the entry form (create) for contacts in BlankFragment.kt

Contacts are stored by using the SQLite database queries.
